#Java Methods Progarmming

It is a Java repositary that the owner is using to learn Java methods. The methods the owner is 
trying to learn are Java SE, Servlets & JSP, GoF Design Patterns, JUnit, Log4j, Ant, UML, SQL, 
JPA, Hibernate.

Initally i was going to do some work with a swift project but after reviewing and studying the project,
i came to the realization that I could not do anything with the project and decided to find something
else. And that is how i found this project.

##README.md (Artifact 1)

After I decided to work on this project I notced that there was no README.md for it. So I decided to 
create one for it.

The README.md covers what the repositary is being used for. As well as of right now covers the GOF 
design patterns.
